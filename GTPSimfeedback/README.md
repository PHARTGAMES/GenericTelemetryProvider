# SpaceMonkey SimFeedback


SpaceMonkey Simfeedback is a SimFeedback plugin for the SpaceMonkey Telemetry Provider.

### Setup

1. Install SpaceMonkey Telemetry Provider and follow instructions here. https://github.com/PHARTGAMES/SpaceMonkey
2. Install SpaceMonkey SimFeedback into your root SimFeedback folder using the installer here. https://github.com/PHARTGAMES/SpaceMonkey/raw/main/GTPSimfeedback/Installer/SpaceMonkeySFX-SetupFiles/SpaceMonkeySFX.msi

### Usage

1. Launch SpaceMonkeyTP.exe
2. Configure SpaceMonkeyTP.exe as described here https://github.com/PHARTGAMES/SpaceMonkey
3. Select the SpaceMonkey compatible profile in SimFeedback and press Start. For STAR WARS: Squadrons it's recommended to use the base STAR WARS: Squadrons profile because it handles the high accelerations and rotations differently to the default Space Monkey profile. As of v1.0.4 PitchVelocity and RollVelocity have been added to the default Space Monkey profile, these can be used in conjunction with or as a replacement for Pitch and Roll in cars and aircraft.

To use SpaceMonkey in conjunction with other supported software follow the guide here https://github.com/PHARTGAMES/SpaceMonkey
