# SpaceMonkey - Open Source Telemetry Provider.

SpaceMonkey was created to be a telemetry interface for games with no native telemetry support. 

SpaceMonkey mimics the functionality of the Codemasters Dirt 4 custom udp format which allows SpaceMonkey to be used via the UDP protocol by any software that already supports Dirt 4 and Dirt Rally 2.0 custom udp.
SpaceMonkey also optionally writes telemetry to a Memory Mapped File as an alternative to UDP.

SpaceMonkey contains telemetry visualisation and filtering functionality.

Supported Games
